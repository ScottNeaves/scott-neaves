# * and ** in python

\* and \*\* in python allow you to pass variable numbers of arguments into a function. There are two scenarios in which \* and \*\* are used: (1) in the _definition_ of a function, and (2) in the _invocation_ of a function. The two scenarios are often used in conjunction with each other, which is a situation I will address in section (3). A few other tidbits and slightly more uncommon scenarios are discussed in section (4)

## 1. function definition
When used in the definition of a function, \* and \*\* allow you to accept variable numbers of _positional_, and _keyword_ arguments, respectively.

___
Note: A positional argument is an unnamed argument, as in `def my_func(swimmer, runner):`. A keyword argument is a named argument, as in `def myfunc(swimmer='Michael Phelps', runner='Usain Bolt'):`
___

### positional case:
In the positional case, the argument which has the single asterisk in front of it (which, by convention, has the name "args") has type `tuple`.

```
>>> def print_everything(*args):
...		print("Type of 'args': " + type(args).__name__)
...     for thing in args:
...         print thing
...
>>> print_everything('apple', 'banana', 'cabbage')
Type of 'args': tuple
apple
banana
cabbage
```

### keyword case:
In the keyword case, the argument which has the two asterisks in front of it (which, by convention, has the name "kwargs", short for "keyword arguments"), has type `dict`.

```
>>> def print_everything(**kwargs):
...		print("Type of 'kwargs': " + type(kwargs).__name__)
... 	for name, value in kwargs.items():
... 		print '{0} = {1}'.format(name, value)
...
 >>> print_everything(apple='fruit', cabbage='vegetable')
Type of 'kwargs': dict
cabbage = vegetable
apple = fruit
```

## 2. function invocation

When used in the _invocation_ of a function, \* and *\* allow you to _pass_ variable numbers of positional and keyword arguments into a function call.

### positional case:
In the positional case, the variable which you choose to put a * in front of should be a list. Putting * in front of a list and passing it into a function allows you to pass a variable number of _positional_ arguments into that function.

```
>>> def print_three_things(a, b, c):
...     print 'a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}'.format(a,b,c)
...
>>> mylist = ['aardvark', 'baboon', 'cat']
>>> print_three_things(*mylist)
a = aardvark, b = baboon, c = cat
```
The asterisk in front of `mylist` basically turns `mylist` into `'aardvark', 'baboon', 'cat'`. This way you don't have to know exactly how many elements will be in `mylist` when it is passed into `print_three_things`, and you can still be guaranteed that they will all be passed in (as positional args).

### keyword case:
In the keyword case, the variable which you choose to put a \*\* in front of should be a dict. Putting a ** in front of a dict and passing it into a function allows you to pass a variable number of _keyword_ arguments into that function.

```
>>> def print_three_things(a=None, b=None, c=None):
...     print 'a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}'.format(a,b,c)
...
>>> my_dict = {'a':'aardvark', 'b': 'baboon', 'c':'cat'}
>>> print_three_things(**my_dict)
a = aardvark, b = baboon, c = cat
```

Similarly, the two asterisks in front of `mydict` basically turns `mydict` into `a='aardvark', b='baboon', c='cat'`. It unpacks what's in the dictionary and matches each key to each keyword argument. This way you don't have to know exactly how many items are in the dict in order to pass them all into the function (as keyword arguments).


## 3. function definition and invocation go hand-in-hand
Naturally, if you're going to write a function that accepts a variable number of arguments, you're probably going to want to invoke that function in such a way where you can pass a variable number of arguments into it. So functions that are defined using \* or \*\* are often _invoked_ using \* or \*\*.

```
>>> def print_everything(*args):
...     for thing in args:
...             print thing
...
>>> vegetarian_foods = ['apple', 'banana', 'cabbage']
>>> print_everything(*vegetarian_foods)
apple
banana
cabbage
>>> vegetarian_foods = ['apple', 'banana', 'cabbage', 'kale', 'yams']
>>> print_everything(*vegetarian_foods)
apple
banana
cabbage
kale
yams
```
No matter how long the "vegetarian_foods" array gets, the `print_everything` function can always handle it!

## 4. Other Tidbits
A fun fact about * and ** is that you can use them together! The only rule is that the single-asterisk argument (args) must come before the double-asterisk argument (kwargs) in the function definition. "args" will receive all the positional arguments, and "kwargs" will receive all the keyword arguments.

```
>>> def print_everything(*args, **kwargs):
...      print "==vegetarian foods: =="
...      for food in args:
...          print food
...      print "==vegetarian foods by category: =="
...      for category, foods in kwargs.items():
...          print '{0}: {1}'.format(category, foods)
...
>>> vegetarian_foods = ['apple', 'banana', 'cabbage']
>>> vegetarian_foods_by_category = {
...     'fruits': ['apple', 'banana'],
...     'vegetables': ['cabbage']
... }
>>> print_everything(*vegetarian_foods, **vegetarian_foods_by_category)
==vegetarian foods: ==
apple
banana
cabbage
==vegetarian foods by category: ==
vegetables: ['cabbage']
fruits: ['apple', 'banana']
```
Another interesting and occasionally important thing to know is that "args" receives a tuple containing only the positional arguments _beyond the formal parameter list_, and, likewise, "kwargs" receives a dict containing only the _keyword_ arguments beyond the formal _keyword_ parameter list.

```
>>> def print_everything(a_positional_arg, *args):
...     print "== first arg: =="
...     print a_positional_arg
...     print "== args: =="
...     print args
...
>>> vegetarian_foods = ['apple', 'banana', 'cabbage']
>>> print_everything('positional arg', *vegetarian_foods)
== first arg: ==
positional arg
== args: ==
('apple', 'banana', 'cabbage')


>>> def print_everything(a_keyword_arg, **kwargs):
...     print "== first arg: =="
...     print a_keyword_arg
...     print "== kwargs: =="
...     print kwargs
...
>>> vegetarian_foods_by_category = {
...     'fruit': 'apple',
...     'vegetable': 'cabbage'
... }
>>> print_everything(a_keyword_arg="keyword arg", **vegetarian_foods_by_category)
== first arg: ==
keyword arg
== kwargs: ==
{'vegetable': 'cabbage', 'fruit': 'apple'}
```
