# The technical / non-technical divide

When I was a software development intern at J.P. Morgan in the summer of 2013, a project manager I worked with turned to me and made a comment I found rather peculiar at the time:

{with an air of real genuineness and surprise} “Wow, you like to talk to people _and_ you’re a software developer! The other devs don’t talk to us – I wish they’d learn a thing or two from you!”

To hear this is no longer something that would be a surprise – I have since come to understand more clearly what is sometimes referred to as the “technical / non-technical divide.”

The “divide” doesn’t just show up in professional settings between software developers and their non-developer coworkers. It shows up all the time, between family members, friends, between a person and his/her doctor, CPA, lawyer, or anyone else with whom you may need to have in-depth communication.

No matter where the “divide” shows up, the problem is pretty much the same – party “A” in the communication begins to feel like party “B”  “won’t answer the question,“ or “can’t stay on topic.” Party “B” begins to feel frustrated by the fact that party “A” “just can’t seem to move on,” “isn’t being open-minded, ” or “keeps asking questions that I have already given an answer to.”  

In these situations, usually what is happening is that party “A” using a linear train of thought to try to solve a problem within constraints or understand some information. Party “B” may not be trying to solve a problem at all, or may be using non-linear thinking to try to solve the problem.

_Both ways of thinking are useful and necessary._

Educationally, and professionally, I come from a background where structured linear thinking is easily the most effective. But I’m not just paying lip service to the benefits and appropriateness of non-linearity of thought. In fact, non-linearity is probably the more appropriate mode more often than not.

Situations in which linearity is most effective:


-	debugging of any kind (software or otherwise)
-	trying to understand complicated causal or otherwise structured information in which new information builds on previous information
-	faithfully executing detailed or complicated tasks

Situations in which non-linearity is most effective:


-	building relationships with other people
-	empathizing with others
-	small talk
-	playing of any kind
-	creating novel solutions to problems that do not come with tight constraints
-	music, art, dance, improv comedy, writing fiction, or any other art form _(can be viewed as a special case of “creating novel solutions to problems that do not come with tight constraints”)_

When “party A” and “party B” are interacting in a problem domain or environment in which structured, linear thinking is the preferred mode (e.g. software development), the person more disposed to linear thinking can start to see the person more disposed to non-linear thinking as less capable in general. This is entirely not the case. Fish may not make great runners, but gazelle don’t make great swimmers.

There’s a tendency among some programmers to disparage roles where non-linear thinking is more valuable as “touchy-feely,” or “fluffy”. But those “touchy-feely” roles are often the most important ones in the company - those are the roles that explore product-market fit, build business relationships, provide friendly and empathetic support to users, and craft the interface of the app to be discoverable and attractive.

Aside from the business aspects of a software company (which is necessarily a creative, open-ended relationship-building endeavor), every piece of software intended to help people eventually interfaces with people. It’s right there on the border where those touchy-feely skills get _real_ useful :).

Many software developers know this, of course. I think what’s missing is that our non-linear counterparts don’t know that we know this. They often feel looked down upon and shut out, instead of celebrated and included. We can all help each other by recognizing the real value in each others’ contributions.

And beyond all that, they may really be onto something. Reasoning about life in a structured manner won't help you form deep friendships, fall in love, experience beauty, authentically feel pain, see the truth about yourself and others, or feel the flow of life. You have to turn off your problem-solving brain to do that, and just live.
