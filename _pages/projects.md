### Community Carpool Marketing site

Community Carpool is an NJ-based tech startup creating a safe and convenient ridesharing solution for kids. I designed the startup's marketing site and coded it as a static site using Jekyll. You can see it here: [communitycarpool.org](communitycarpool.org).


### Curl Builder

Curl Builder is free online cURL command builder. The included features are ones that I find useful when using cURL to debug cantankerous third-party APIs. An incomplete feature list:

- autocomplete for common header values
- code editor to help write complex XML and JSON query bodies
- copy-to-clipboard
- quick "save" feature which allows you to share your cURL command via a unique URL.

Curl Builder started as a teaching project I came up with to teach someone close to me web development. After its purpose as a teaching project was outlived, I took it a bit further and polished it to the point where it is now. Feedback welcome!

### Where's Willie

Where's Willie was a website I created during my last year at university to help members of the senior class to see where everyone else is moving to after graduation. 750 NU seniors signed up (~35% of senior class). Some people found roommates through it, and others just found out that they had some acquaintances from school moving to the same city as them, so they didn't have to start a new life in a strange city all on their own :).
